NOT MINE (DUNE-STUDIOS)


Spotify Lite is not an alternative of Spotify, it's still spotify just built with neutralino.js to make the utility completely lite for low-end PC users or medium-end PC users
The reason it was created because Spotify likes to use up all your ram. I suggest using this, it has every feature you need.
